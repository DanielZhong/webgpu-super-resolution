# webgpu-super-resolution

We need to consider the different ways of storing the matrix
batch_size * channel_size * height * width to mirror pytorch
only support batchsize of 1 rn
There is a potential bug of i32 and u32 for global id
Does wgsl support loop unrolling?
Webgpu documntation incomplete for command encoders pipelines etc.
Add package.json
Is there any issue with adding bias?
